# DeluxeBench

> [!NOTE]
> This tool is currently in development to get reworked, some of the content of this README may not be correct compared to the current available release!

A light weight and simplistic tool for creating content (items and animations) for [Superfighters Deluxe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/855860/Superfighters_Deluxe/), made with [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/).

### CREDITS

- [Portable File Dialogs](https://github.com/samhocevar/portable-file-dialogs) library by ["Sam Hocevar"](https://github.com/samhocevar).

### LEGACY CLI USAGE

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Liokindy/SFDItemTool/releases).

2. Use a terminal and run `SFDItemTool.exe`, or use a pre-created `.bat` file (only in Windows).

> [!NOTE]
> All files are read and written to the tool's "save directory". The path to it should be similar to `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE` in Windows or to `~/.local/share/love/` in Linux. This folder will only be created automatically when you run the tool with an action, even if no files are processed.
>
> The Windows release contains a shortcut that will point to it.

Options:

```
	-input [path]
```

The path of the input folder. Defaults to `Input`.

```
	-output [path]
```

The path of the output folder. Defaults to `Output`.

```
	-to [item|folder|pass]
```

What action to do with files in the input folder, and then use the output folder as a destination.
- `item`, assumes files in the input folder are all `.item` files. Exports them to folders that include `.png` files and a `.ini` file containing properties of the item.
- `folder`, assumes files in the input folder are all folders with `.png` files and a valid `.ini` file. Exports them to `.item` files.
- `pass`, assumes files in the input folder are all `.item` files. Exports them back to `.item` files.
